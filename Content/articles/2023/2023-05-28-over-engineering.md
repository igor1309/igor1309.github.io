# Your Over-engineering May Be A Problem

[Your Overengineering May Be A Problem](https://youtu.be/FLe5dvqV6xs) is a excellent 20 min talk (always watch at x1.5) by Dave Farley.

Main take away speaks dearly to my heart: do not plan for the hypothetical future that you have no specifics about, avoid designing for future features that you donâ€™t really understand or need right now, stick to fundamentals - build low coupled, modular system with clear separation of concerns that is easy to change.
