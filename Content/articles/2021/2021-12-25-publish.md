# Website with Publish

By John Sundell
[JohnSundell/Publish: A static site generator for Swift developers](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish)



Why Publish (motivation/reasons)

* Use Swift, Markdown, Git and GitHub
* Use Working copy, iA Writer and iPad
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) and Ruby drive me crazy
* John Sundell is awesome


## Getting started with Publish

  * Deploy new website version each time you commit changes to our blog repository using Github Actions
    * Use iPad for blogging (with Working copy and iA Writer)
    
    * BEWARE IMPORTANT: ... if you use custom domain (GitHub repo Settings/Pages), otherwise deploying would overwrite custom domain (the repo's "Custom domain" setting is reset)

  * Add highlighting to source files: The author of the Publish generator also wrote the [Splash](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Splash) library, which allows you to highlight source codes. It is connected as a package in the Swift Package Manager.
