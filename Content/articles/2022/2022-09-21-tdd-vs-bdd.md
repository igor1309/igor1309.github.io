# Dave Farley: TDD vs BDD

[Test Driven Development vs Behavior Driven Development - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq_oz7nCNUA)

Totally worth watching. From the video description:

> TDD vs BDD, Test Driven Development vs Behaviour Driven Development which is most important to get right? Most people think of BDD and TDD as having distinctly different focusses in an effective automated testing strategy. In fact they are more closely related than many people think.
>
> In this episode on the [Continuous Delivery channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ContinuousDelivery), Dave Farley, who was involved in the creation of BDD, explains his slightly more unusual take on the real value of this approach to creating automated tests. Dave believes that TDD and BDD are at the foundations of a sound software engineering approach to software development and explores these ideas with some real-world examples of good and bad automated tests.
