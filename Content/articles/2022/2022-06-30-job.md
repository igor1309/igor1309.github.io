Use STAR framework:
1. __Situation__ (setup).
2. __Task__
3. __Action__
4. __Result__. Do not rely on your talents as a storyteller and the ability of a listener to draw the right conclusions, state the result yourself.

Plus:
1. Smile!
2. Buy Time if Necessary
3. Answer Enthusiastically
4. Ask a Follow Up Question

> Interview is a two-way street. They interview you, but you also interview them. Reverse-engineer the interview at the end.
