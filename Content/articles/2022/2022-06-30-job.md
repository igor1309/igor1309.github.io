You can have multiple profiles. The more you define your profile the better search results you’ll get.

Use the [STAR method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) to structure your story:

1. __Situation__ (setup).
2. __Task__
3. __Action__
4. __Result__. Control the narrative. Do not rely on your talents as a storyteller and the ability of a listener to draw the right conclusion(s), state the result yourself.

Plus:

1. Smile!
2. Buy Time if Necessary
3. Answer Enthusiastically
4. Ask a Follow Up Question

Some questions I’ve seen a lot:

- What makes you interested in a role at … ?
- What skills would you like to develop in the next 12 months?
- Tell us about a project where you learned a lot. What would you do differently?
- Please describe a project you recently worked on that was technically challenging. What made it challenging? How did you overcome its difficulties?
- Tell us about an interesting app you’ve worked on. What made it interesting?
- How do you use our products, or their competitors? How would you improve one of them?

## Interviews

Nervous? Make your brain think you’re excited!


> Don’t think about the outcome, be willing to learn and improve.
>
> Interview is a two-way street. They interview you, but you also interview them. Reverse-engineer the interview at the end.
>

### Get to know

- Make them love you
- __Positioning__. Connect skillset and experience to the goals and pain points of the company. Learn about the company, its goals, its current pain points, who their customers were, and little things that would help give better answers that would resonate with the interviewer. I find April Dunford’s thoughts and approaches quite helpful, see links in the [Cover Letter](#cover-letter) section.

## Offer negotiation/ Salary negotiation (II)

### You should negotiate

1. There could be money or other benefits on the table (actually “are” - see #3), but you might never know if you don’t ask. So, ask. Nicely.
2. No one ever revoked the offer just because the candidate politely(!) asked for more.
3. They are prepared - they do have more just in case someone they really like asks for more.

### Email vs phone

Pick whatever is more comfortable for you, but don’t forget, that it’s possible to misinterpret any text, and it’s easier to clarify things in the live conversation.

### Keep positive

This is not a war or fight. Use collaborative tactics. Image yourself discussing lunch options with friends.

### “No”

Don’t take “no” personally. “No” is just “no”.

### Offer Structure

Consider the whole offer structure, not just the base salary, but bonuses, one-time payments, perks, options/RSUs, relocation packages, etc.
