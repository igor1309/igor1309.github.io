# Essential Blue Belt

Iâ€™m super excited and proud to share that Iâ€™ve completed the [iOS Lead Essentials](https://iosacademy.essentialdeveloper.com/p/ios-lead-essentials/) program at the [Essential Developer](http://essentialdeveloper.com/) ðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™ve been following [Caio Zullo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caiozullo/) and [Mike Apostolakis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mapostolakis/) for some time via their excellent [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/EssentialDeveloper) before joining the program last December. Their classical way of teaching based on fundamentals and best industry practices speaks dearly to my heart.

SOLID principles, design patterns, CI/CD, TDD, architecture, and modularity are not just some buzzwords for the CV or tech interview but __essential__ (sic!) and vital concepts deeply ingrained in every step of app dev.

It has become second nature to start coding with

```swift
func test_smth_shouldDeliverThis_onThat() {
    let sut = makeSUT()
```

I canâ€™t recommend this course enough as a great source of knowledge, ideas, and inspiration. I have no doubt they will continue to be an essential and valuable part of the developer community and I plan to be a part of it in years to come.

Thank you, Caio, Mike, [Bogdan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpoplauschi/), [Raphael Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphsilva/), [Marko Engelman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-engelman/), Danil Lahtin, and all instructors and students of the Academy!
